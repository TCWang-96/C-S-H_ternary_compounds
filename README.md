# C-S-H_ternary_compounds

This repository includes crystal structure files of ternary C-S-H compounds as supplemental materials to "Absence of conventional room temperature superconductivity at high pressure in carbon doped H<sub>3</sub>S" by T. Wang et al. (arXiv:2104.03710).

The structure files are written in the format of POSCAR file used in VASP.

Structures of elemental C, S, and H are used as references for the formation enthalpy calculations.

Structures of binary compounds are used as references to phase diagram of the C-S-H convex hull.
